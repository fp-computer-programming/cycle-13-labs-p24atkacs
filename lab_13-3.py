# This variable (weekdays) I set equal to a tuple that contains the days Monday - Friday as strings

weekdays = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Create a variable, weekends, and set it equal to a tuple that contains Saturday and Sunday as strings

weekends = ("Saturday", "Sunday")

# Create a variable called days_of_the_week and set it equal to the concatenation of the two previous variables.

days_of_the_week = weekdays + weekends


#prints all of the days of the week in order.
print(days_of_the_week)
