#  I Created a list called day_date that contains the number day for the next 5 days.
day_date = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# I used the tuple and assigned the 5 letters from the list to a variable that represents each day using a single statement.
mon, tue, wed, thu, fri = tuple(day_date)

# Prints each of them to get what number I set them equal to.  
print("mon:", mon)
print("tue:", tue)
print("wed:", wed)
print("thu:", thu)
print("fri:", fri)

#works.
